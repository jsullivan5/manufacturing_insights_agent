# 🧠 Phase 2: Full LLM-Powered Manufacturing Copilot

I want to move beyond a deterministic tool wrapper. The goal now is to build an **LLM-powered assistant** that analyzes time-series PI-style data, explains anomalies, infers causes, and recommends actions — all in natural language.

---

## 🔧 Current Status

- I have working tools: `load_data`, `detect_spike`, `correlate_tags`, `generate_chart`, etc.
- I have an interpreter that parses time ranges and tags from user input.
- The current interpreter routes to tools based on keywords. **That must be replaced.**

---

## 🧠 What I Need This System To Do (LLM Reasoning Layer)

### 💬 Natural Language Queries
The assistant must:
- Parse user intent, tags, and time ranges using GPT, not regex or keyword matching.
- Route intelligently to tool functions based on parsed intent.

### 🧪 Multistep Tool Use
The assistant must:
- Call tools sequentially and logically (e.g., load → detect → correlate → chart)
- Chain results together into context-aware insights
- Use intermediate results as reasoning context

### 📈 LLM-Powered Explanations
The assistant must:
- Interpret the results of tool functions (e.g., anomalies and correlations)
- Explain them in natural language like a process engineer would
- Highlight potential causes and suggest next investigative steps

### 🧠 GPT Inputs
Use structured prompts like:
```json
{
  "query": "Were there any anomalies in the freezer last week?",
  "tag": "TEMP_INTERNAL",
  "time_range": ["2024-06-14", "2024-06-21"],
  "summary_stats": {...},
  "anomalies": [...],
  "correlations": [...],
  "tag_glossary": {...}
}
```

# ✅ Phase 3: Refinement & Polish
