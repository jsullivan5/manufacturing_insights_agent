# Manufacturing Copilot - Core Analytical Tool Functions: Implementation Status

## Overview

This document outlines the completion status of core analytical tool functions for the Manufacturing Copilot. Each function has been implemented with a focus on testing, error handling, and includes `__main__` blocks for isolated validation where appropriate.

## Completed Tool Functions

### 1. `detect_spike()` - Anomaly Detection

**Location**: `src/tools/anomaly_detection.py`

**Capabilities**:
- Z-score based detection using rolling window statistics.
- Configurable parameters: `threshold` (default: 3.0), `window_size` (default: 10).
- Anomaly classification: High/low spikes with severity levels (normal, extreme).
- Statistical significance testing with t-statistics.
- Comprehensive output: Tuples of (timestamp, value, z_score, reason).

**Additional Functions**:
- `detect_consecutive_anomalies()`: Groups anomalies into sustained periods.
- `analyze_anomaly_patterns()`: Provides statistical analysis of anomaly distribution.

**Testing Status**:
- Verified detection of anomalies in freezer data (e.g., 4 anomalies with threshold 2.0).
- Tested with both real manufacturing data and synthetic test cases.
- Error handling for edge cases implemented.

### 2. `correlate_tags()` - Correlation Analysis

**Location**: `src/tools/correlation.py`

**Capabilities**:
- Multi-type correlation analysis:
  - Pearson correlation for linear relationships.
  - Change correlation for rate-of-change relationships.
  - Time-lagged correlation for leading/lagging indicators.
- Statistical validation: Significance testing and strength interpretation.
- Timestamp alignment: Handles misaligned data with configurable tolerance.
- Comprehensive metadata: Data points, ranges, significance levels.

**Additional Functions**:
- `find_correlated_tags()`: Convenience function for automatic tag discovery.
- Helper functions for significance testing and strength interpretation.

**Testing Status**:
- Successfully analyzed correlations between temperature, power, and other relevant metrics.
- Tested with both synthetic data (known correlations) and real manufacturing data.
- Statistical significance calculation verified.

### 3. `generate_chart()` - Visualization

**Location**: `src/tools/visualization.py`

**Capabilities**:
- Generation of time series plots with configurable styling.
- Anomaly highlighting: Shaded regions with duration annotations.
- Statistical overlays: Mean, standard deviation bands, trend lines.
- Data quality indicators: Visual markers for Good/Questionable/Bad data.
- Automatic formatting: Time axis formatting based on data range.
- Output: 300 DPI PNG files with consistent styling.

**Additional Functions**:
- `generate_correlation_chart()`: Dual-axis correlation visualization.
- Helper functions for trend lines, statistical bands, and formatting.

**Testing Status**:
- Generated charts for freezer temperature data.
- Successfully highlighted anomaly periods with annotations.
- Created correlation charts (e.g., temperature vs. power consumption).
- Charts saved to `charts/` directory with timestamped filenames.

## Architecture Summary

### Modular Design
- Functions are designed with clear interfaces and comprehensive docstrings.
- Independent testing facilitated via `__main__` blocks in each module.
- Implemented error handling with informative messages.
- Consistent return types and parameter validation are used.

### Integration Readiness

- Parameters are configurable for different use cases.

### Code Quality Standards
- Comprehensive logging with appropriate log levels.
- Type hints and detailed docstrings following project guidelines.
- Robust validation of input parameters and data.
- Organized output with proper file naming conventions.

## Testing Results Overview

### Real Data Testing
- **Dataset**: 50,400 data points across 5 PI tags (7-day freezer operation example).
- **Anomaly Detection**: Verified detection of 4 anomalies with threshold 2.0 in the example dataset.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Successfully analyzed relationships between temperature, power, and door status in the example dataset.
- **Visualization**: Generated relevant charts with anomaly highlighting for the example dataset.

### Synthetic Data Testing
- Utilized controlled scenarios with known anomalies and correlations.
- Validated behavior for edge cases (e.g., empty data, insufficient points).
- Performed statistical verification of correlation calculations.

### Integration Testing
- Cross-function compatibility has been verified.
- Tested end-to-end workflow: data loading → anomaly detection → correlation → visualization.
- Import system confirmed to be working correctly.

## Next Steps: Enhanced Interpreter Integration

With the core tool functions implemented and tested, the next phase involves integrating them into the query interpreter for more advanced analysis capabilities:

### 1. Enhancing `interpret_query()` Function
```python
def interpret_query(query: str) -> str:
    # Current: Basic statistical summary.
    # Targeted Enhancement: Include anomaly detection, correlation analysis, chart generation.
    
    # 1. Parse query and load data (existing).
    # 2. Generate statistical summary (existing).
    # 3. Detect anomalies using detect_spike() (to be integrated).
    # 4. Find correlated tags using correlate_tags() (to be integrated).
    # 5. Generate visualization using generate_chart() (to be integrated).
    # 6. Provide actionable insights and recommendations (to be developed).
```

### 2. LLM Reasoning Layer Development
- Develop natural language explanations for detected anomalies.
- Implement root cause analysis based on correlation findings.
- Formulate operational recommendations based on identified patterns.
- Incorporate context-aware insights using manufacturing domain knowledge where applicable.

## Implementation Summary
