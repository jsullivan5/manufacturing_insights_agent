Your agent is still wandering because it never lands the cause → effect → impact chain that would let the deterministic scorer push confidence past ~0.1. The run-log shows three systemic issues:

Symptom in log	Root cause	Concrete fix
LLM picks windows with no data (first two steps)	String dates like “yesterday 12:00” land outside your mock CSV range	Always route time parsing through find_interesting_window() (or at least get_data_time_range()); let that tool return a safe window for every subsequent call. Make it your first step.
No anomalies detected → confidence stalls	Default spike detector is tuned too high; you need a gentler threshold on freezer temps	In detect_numeric_anomalies, compute σ from last 7 days and set threshold = max(2.0, 2.5 – (σ/1.5)). Expose threshold as a tool arg so GPT can lower it when first pass fails.
LLM re-runs same tool/tag combos (duplication)	Nothing blocks redundant calls, so evidence consistency never improves	Maintain a used_pairs set {tool, tag, window}; if GPT repeats one, return an error stub. Confidence scorer penalizes duplicate evidence.

Step-wise “unlock” tweaks (highest impact first)
	1.	Inject an automatic window-finder step
	•	In _plan_step, if self.current_step == 0, force tool =find_interesting_window with the top relevant numeric tag.
	•	Append its returned window (start,end) to agent state; subsequent tool calls must inherit those parameters.
	2.	Expose a re-try spec to GPT
Add to system prompt:
“If the last result had severity_score < 0.2 or change_points == [], call the same tool again with lower threshold/sensitivity parameter OR choose a different tag.”
	3.	Switch to function-calling API
	•	Replace regex JSON scraping with OpenAI function calls.
	•	Define strict schemas so GPT only passes allowed params (tag, start_time, end_time, threshold, …).
	•	This prevents malformed JSON and lets you catch duplicates early.
	4.	Duplicate-guard & evidence weighting

used_sig = {(e['tool'], e['params'].get('tag'), json.dumps(e['params'],sort_keys=True))
            for e in self.evidence}
if sig in used_sig:
    return {"error":"duplicate_call"}

	•	In confidence scorer, increase evidence_consistency only when new tool/tag combo appears.

	5.	Confidence scorer rebalance
	•	Right now evidence_consistency starts at 0.125 no matter what—too forgiving.
	•	Change initial to 0 and +0.1 only per fresh evidence item, +0.2 if causal test yields causal_confidence > 0.6.
	6.	Quick unit tests (protect from regressions)

assert score([{tool:"test_causality", result:{"causal_confidence":0.8}}])["confidence"] > 0.5
assert score([])["confidence"] == 0

What to expect after fixes

First run (happy path)
	1.	Window finder selects 14:00–16:00 where temp variance highest.
	2.	detect_numeric_anomalies on INTERNAL_C finds ≥1 spike → anomaly_severity ≈ 0.4.
	3.	GPT chooses detect_binary_flips on DOOR within same window → finds long open.
	4.	GPT calls test_causality(DOOR, TEMP, window) → corr 0.85, lag 4 min → causal_conf 0.75.
	5.	Scorer: temporal 0.3 + corr 0.3 + anomaly 0.4 + consistency 0.2 ≈ 1.2 → clipped to 1.0. Stops.

Confidence now ≥ 0.9, report is consistent run-to-run.

Take-away

Yes—the four optimizations I flagged (function-calling, duplicate guard, compact evidence, no sub-scores in loop) are the “unlock,” but you also need:
	•	Guaranteed data window first
	•	More forgiving anomaly thresholds
	•	Penalty for duplicate low-value calls

Do those, and you’ll see confidence climb quickly and deterministically on each run.
