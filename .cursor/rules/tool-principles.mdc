## ðŸ§  MCP Tool Design Principles

Use these rules when implementing or modifying core analysis tools in the Manufacturing Copilot.

### 1. Narrow Time Windows Early
- Always limit analysis to a specific time window based on user input or detected anomaly.
- Never process the full dataset unless explicitly required.

### 2. Tag-Centric Processing
- Operate on only the relevant tags retrieved via semantic search.
- Avoid brute-force iteration across the full glossary.

### 3. Statistical Parsimony
- Prefer simple, explainable stats: mean, min, max, std, and linear trend.
- Use z-score or simple deltas for anomaly detection before reaching for complex models.

### 4. Correlation, Not Causation
- Highlight temporal correlations between tags, but do not infer causality.
- Provide supporting evidence with metrics, timestamps, and charts.

### 5. Modularity
- Keep tools like `summarize_metric`, `detect_spike`, and `correlate_tags` independent and composable.
- Favor small, testable units over complex multi-purpose functions.

### 6. Explainability
- Outputs must be understandable by a non-technical user.
- Include timestamps, units, and chart references in all summaries.

### 7. Fail Fast, Log Verbosely
- Handle edge cases gracefully.
- Use informative log messages and avoid silent failures.
