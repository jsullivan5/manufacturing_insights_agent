## 🧠 Planner Mode Behavior & Usage Guidelines

Planner Mode is a deep-analysis mode where the agent reflects on a feature request, scopes the necessary changes, and produces a structured, step-by-step plan for implementation.

### 🛑 When to Use Planner Mode
- **Only enter Planner Mode when explicitly instructed.**
- Do *not* trigger Planner Mode automatically when uncertain.  
  → If you’re unsure, ask 1–2 direct clarifying questions instead of generating a full plan.

### ✅ What to Do in Planner Mode (When Triggered)
1. **Analyze** the prompt and relevant files to understand the scope.
2. **Ask 4–6 clarifying questions** to close any knowledge gaps.
3. Once answered, **draft a detailed plan of action**.
4. **Wait for my approval** before beginning any implementation.
5. After approval, **implement each step sequentially**, announcing what’s completed and what’s next after every step.

### 📋 Checklist Expectations
- Always create a checklist based on the task or plan—even if the file is incomplete or partially written.
- Place the checklist in `.documentation/notepad/[feature-name].md`.
- Do *not* begin implementing immediately after creating the checklist—wait for my signal.
- As you complete tasks from a checklist, **mark them off** and provide regular progress updates.

### 🔁 Throughout the Process
- Stick to the checklist as the source of truth.
- Push back on bad ideas with questions or counterexamples.
- Prioritize clarity and collaboration over assumptions.
